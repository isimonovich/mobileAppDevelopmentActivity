The purpose of this site was to introduce the user to one of my favorite book series, Eragon.
This site is meant to be simple, yet interactive and informative.

As mentioned before, it is a simple site. There is a Home page with six buttons that bring the user to various other pages, starting with three external links to provide more material to read and communitites to check out.

The final three pages contain various lists and additional buttons and features, such as drop downs and Home buttons, to improve user interaction.

When any button is clicked, the user is brought to the linked page, whether internal or external. Each button has a shadow effect and a clear label. 

The "Inheritance Series" page has a button on the bottom right that, when pressed, brings the user back up to the top of the page.
